The following text blocks are a suggestion only. You are expected to delete or amend them.
Please write in full sentences, in English or German.
You can skip writing anything here if your commit messages already cover the »what« and »why« for the changes.

This contribution…

  - addresses issue #NN. (Write `closes #NN` or `fixes #NN` in commit messages only.)
  - introduces a new feature X for use-cases such as Y.

Detail the »why« of the most popular use-cases here.  
Please collect extensive details in a separate comment to your PR, because this first text will likely become part of
the commit- or merge message text.

Checklist for your convenience:

  - [ ] Any new options are documented in the README file(s) as part of this PR.
  - [ ] Add (create if need be) your name to file `CONTRIBUTORS` (bugs/flaws/tests) or `AUTHORS` (else).
  - [ ] Rebase your PR (`git rebase wmark/master`).
    (You don't need to rebase again on later conflicts with non-code files.)
  - [ ] State if this is a suggestion, if you are not 100% sure whether you have covered any edge-cases.  
    In that case, I will follow-up by reviewing/implementing/testing, and change your code if need be.
    Else you will be expected to entertain change requests to the submitted source code and documentation
    to the best of your abilities, but be in charge of the details.
